Born and raised in the Providence, Rhode Island, I was a bookseller before making the leap to be a full-time writer. I transitioned to publishing where I worked at a literary development company, as a creative writing college instructor, and as a book reviewer of childrenâ€™s and young adult novels. I now live in Portland, Oregon exploring the luscious green forest for my next story.
